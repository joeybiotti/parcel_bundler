# Parcel Bundler

Getting my feet wet with the brand new <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel bundler</a>. It's super fast and super simple to set up. This app pulls a random joke from the Chuck Norris Joke API, which can be found <a hef="http://www.icndb.com/api/">here</a>.

Besides Parcel, the app uses JQuery, Sass, and Axios (which I had never used before). In `jokes.js`, the same Promise is written three different ways. Two are commented out solely for functionality purposes and so I could reference later.

I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYZTFooDB24">tutorial</a> as a guide.
